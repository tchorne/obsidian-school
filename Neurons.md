### Neurons
Respond to stimuli
Cannot reproduce
Conduct electrochemical signals
Release chemicals
Tissues of neurons called nerves
Vary in shape and size

Composed of:
- Cell body (in middle)
- Dendrites - carry impusles towards cell body, surround cell body
- Axons - carry impulses away from cell body
	- Axon hillock (start) -> branching axon terminals
	- Myelin sheath - fatty coating coating axon
		- Insulation, prevent loss of ions
		- Schwann cells (type of [[Glial Cells]]) make up myelin sheath
		- nodes of Ranvier - gaps between myelin sheath, axon exposed
	- Neurilemma - membrane surrounding some axons in peripheral system
		- Regenerates damaged axons


#### Classifications of neurons
Nerve signalling: Reception -> Transmission -> Integration -> Response

Sensory Neurons ( #Afferent neurons)
- Sense & Relay info from environment to interneurons
- ex. photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors
- Form in clusters outside of [[Nervous System|CNS]] called *ganglia*

Interneurons (found in brain and spinal chord)
- Link sensory neurons with efferent neurons
- Integrate and interpret sensory info

#Efferent Neurons
- Send impulses from CNS to effectors (motor neurons)


White matter:
- Nerve cells *with* protective myelin & neurilemma

Grey matter:
- Nerve cells *without* protective myelin & neurilemma
	- Damage is permenent
