Produces 3 hormones:
- #Glucocorticoids (type: cortisol) ([[Steroid hormones| steroid hormone]])
	- Inhibits glood glucose intake in most tissues, except brain
	- Increased level of [[amino acids]] in blood -> convert to glucose via liver (source of energy)
	- Excess [[amino acids]] used for protein synthesis (repair damaged cells)
	- Apidose tissue -> fatty acids (source of energy)


#Hyperglymecia : blood sugar levels increase rapidly after meals
	- Kidneys can't reabsorb all glucose -> excess in urine
	- Thirst, frequent urination, vision problems, fatigue, weight loss
	
#Hypoglycemia : blood sugar levels decrease too rapidly
	- Nervousness, shaking, cold sweats, hunger, headaches, weakness
