### Reproductive Hormones
Related: [[Female Reproductive System]], [[Male Reproductive System]]

Sex glands aka. gonads (organs producing gametes & sex hormones)
Ovaries - female
Testes - male

Produce androgens, estrognes , and progestines
More androgens in males
More estrogenes and progestines in females

During puberty, [[hypothalamus]] secretes GnRH
signals [[pituitary gland]] to release
	-	follcile stimulating hormone (FSH) -> production of follicles
follicles stimulate *estrogen* production -> thicken endometrium

Increasing *estrogen* ->
	-	inhibit pituitary to release FSH
	-	increase lutinizing hormone (LH) -> stimulates ovulation & corpus leteum

corpus leutum increases estrogen & progesterone, inhibits FSH and LH
-> therefore no ovulation or contractions

[[Menstrual Cycle]]

Number of viable follicles decrease with age -> decrease in estrogen & progesterone

Menopause: Around age 50, marked by mood changes, high cholesterol, lower bone mass, 'hot flashes' (blood vessels aternately contricting & dialating). Greater risk of cancer of the reproductive organs
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): delivers low doses of estrogen with or without progesterone. Many side effects

### Controlling reproduction with hormones
Birth control pills
	-	bad when they end up in environment
	
Pesticides and plastics
	-	some pesticides and plastics have been found to contain chemicals that mimic human reproductive hormones or block other endocrine hormones
