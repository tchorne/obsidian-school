## Posterior pituitary gland
Stores hormones produced in hypothalamus
- Antidiuretic hormone (Stimulates kindeys to absorb more water, increase blood volume) (alcohol & caffeine inhibit ADH)
- Oxytocin (stimulates release of milk from mammary glands of nursing mothers, secreted into seminilal fluid in males to ensure sperm travels through female reproductive tract)
