## Thyroid Gland
Shaped like a bow tie
Located at base of neck, in front of trachea
regulates body metabolism & rate glucose is oxidized
Produces hormones
- Triiodothyronine (T3)
- Thyroxine (T4 (4 iodine)) -> 65% of secretions
- Calcitonin -> Acts on bone cells to decrease calcium levels in blood

Iodine needed in died to produce these hormones



Increase in thyroxine -> Metabolize quicker
- 60% of oxidized sugar -> heat (warm bodies)
- 40% of oxidized sugar -> ATP (used up)
- Therefore no weight gain
May be hyperthyroidism

Decrease in thyroxine -> Metabolize slower
- Excess blood sugar -> Glycogen & fat
- muscle weakness, cold intolerance, dry skin & hair
May be hypothyroidism

TSH - Thryoid releasing
TSH - Thyroid stimulating

*Thyroid Disorders*

naturally *iodine* is actively transported from blood to thyroid cells
- Therefore increase of iodine within cells
Iodine signals *thyroxine* production

Lack of iodine causes thyroid to be too active (no negative feedback loop, TSH continously produced), leads to swelling, called *Goiter*
