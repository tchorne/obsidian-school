## Growth Hormone (somatotropin)
Aids in growth of long bones & speeds up protein synthesis
Breaks down fate -> fatty acid (source of E) therefore increase in glucose for other reactions

decrease in GH -> dwarfism
increase in GH -> gigantism

GH increases with age (Teens -> adults)
- growth spurts involve muscle build up & loss of fat

decreases with age (seniors)
- therefore cell repair & protein replatecent decrease
- protein replaced with fat, changing body shape
