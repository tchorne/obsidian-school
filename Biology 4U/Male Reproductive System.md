Horomes produced in interstitial cells between seminiferous cells in testes
	-	Androsterone
	-	Testosterone:
		- Most abundant
		- Stimulates *serpatogenesis*
		- 2Â° male characteristics
		
During puberty, [[hypothalamus]] secretes gonadrotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
signals [[pituitary gland]] to release:
	-	follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) -> sperm production
	-	Luteinizing hormone -> testosterone production
testosterone signals for *more* sperm production

Increase in testosterone inhibits hypothaliumus of GnRH production, decreasing LH and testosterone

Andropause: ~age 40 begins
can lead to depression, fatigue, loss of muscle & bone mass, drop in sperm production
can take testosterone
progstate gland also begins to grow
