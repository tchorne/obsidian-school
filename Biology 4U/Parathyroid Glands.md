## Parathyroid glands
- 4 small glands within [[Thyroid Gland|thyroid]] (2 on each posterior side)
- Regulates calcium in blood & decrease phosphate levels
- Parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes Ca ions to increase and phosphate to decrease
- Stimulates enzymes in kidneys to convert vitamin D to calcitrol
- PTH signals for calcium ion absorption from the intestines and kidneys and release form bones
