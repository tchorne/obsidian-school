### Female Reproductive System

Ovaries produce estrogen and progestins -> stimuilate and control development and maintenance of female reproductive system
	-	Estradiol: matures sex organs at puberty, secondary sexual charac.
	- Progesterone: prepares uterus for implatation and embryo development

Hypothalamus -> GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) -> FSH and LH from [[anterior pituitary gland]]

##### Oogenesis & Ovulation
*Follicles* form in ovaries (controlled by [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]]), each contains a single immature egg
2 million at birth, 400'000 viable at puberty
~400 will develope into mature follicle and release an egg
Primary oocyte -> matures into oocyte/ovum 

oocite 1 undergoes meiosis I, creates nutrients and oocyte 2 (haploid)
oocyte 2 released from follicle in ovary -> ovulation

corpus leteum -> left over follicle in ovary -> secretes estrogen & progesterone for pregnancy
deteriorates after 10 days (menstrual cycle)
